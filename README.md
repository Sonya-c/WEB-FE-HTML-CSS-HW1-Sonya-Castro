3. Education: In this section you will list your current career and any additional courses you have taken during your studies. If you have not taken any additional courses, visit the Udemy page, select three courses that catch your attention and list them by adding the word “pending” at the end.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Do not use flexbox, grids or floats to position elements on the page. Try to be creative and use selectors and some of the properties seen in class. You can be guided by the solved code challenge.

- The final result of your cv is a folder with the following files: the first file is the html page. The second file is the css file with the styles. The third file is an img folder where you will save the images to use. The fourth file is the README.md where you will make a very brief description of your project.

- Use the background property to insert a background image in the header section. Find out how to do it.

- For the activity grade, it will be taken into account that the page looks clean, friendly, with a good combination of colors and an eye-catching font style. You must use the same structure shown in the attached image. You can use fonts, colors and in general styles as you like, but keeping the structure as shown.

- All the text on the page must be in English. You can use any existing tool for translation if you require it.
